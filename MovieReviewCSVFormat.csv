DWM_Doc1_TheLostCity,"Aaron and Adam Nee’s The Lost City is one of those rare movies in which, though there isn’t really anything wrong with it, it still manages to fall short of being truly recommendable. Every word I can think of to describe the film is a synonym for “average”. Words like “adequate”, “satisfactory”, and “competent” come to mind. The film knows what it is and it achieves exactly that, never exceeding anybody’s expectations to become something truly exceptional. That’s hardly a glowing review, but, with as many cynical, intelligence-insulting misfires as one can find in theaters at any given time these days, perhaps it should be. There can be something comforting – even reassuring – about a film that does its job sufficiently. We get what we came for and then go home, our memory of the film quickly evaporating. But at least it was vaguely enjoyable while it lasted.The story of The Lost City involves an uptight romance novelist named Loretta (Sandra Bullock) getting pulled into a treasure hunt against her will by a charming rich megalomaniac (Daniel Radcliffe). Loretta’s dim-witted cover model, Alan (Channing Tatum), travels to the remote island where she’s being kept, intending to save her and win her heart. As the two stumble through the treacherous island jungle, they begin to fall in love, realizing that they’re stronger together than apart. This type of story has been done countless times, perhaps most notably in films like The African Queen and Romancing the Stone, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t simple pleasures to be found within. The mismatched nature of the couple and the eventual overcoming of their differences is always a crowd-pleaser, provided the leads have the appropriate chemistry and the situation is believably dire. Thankfully, here, Bullock and Tatum develop an effortless rapport, playing off each other with ease, finding the smaller moments of connection in even the broadest setpieces. And, thankfully, many of those setpieces are organically incorporated into the story and handled efficiently. Too often, though, the filmmakers make the mistake of thinking that their audience is genuinely interested in the treasure hunt element of the story and, unfortunately, spend way too much time explaining the intricate details that should have remained simple window dressing. It’s a common mistake that you’ll find in middle-of-the-road action comedies, and it is one of the few genuine flaws in The Lost City.None of that is to say that the film isn’t enjoyable. I spent much of the film with a smile on my face, but it should be noted that I only laughed out loud once. And I suppose if there were a perfect way to characterize a fine-but-forgettable comedy, that would be it: all smiles, few laughs. It truly is a shame. All the elements are there. If only the film had tried not merely to meet audience expectations but to surpass them, confounding the cliches and surprising us now and then, The Lost City would really be something worth seeing. As it is, despite the film being perfectly competent, I don’t recommend seeing it. Because you already have. Many times."
DWM_Doc2_TheLostCity,"In a setup and general vibe that reminded me of films like Romancing the Stone, The Lost City tells the story of frustrated romance novelist Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock), who has had her greatest and longest success writing the adventures of the same hero character, Dash, whose old-fashioned adventures have made up a series of books that Loretta is looking to wrap up with her latest title. After meeting with her book agent Beth (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), she agrees to a small promotional tour but is tricked into doing her first Q&A with the male model Alan (something of a big, dumb but loyal dog, played by Channing Tatum), who has posed as Dash on the covers of all of her books. As the Q&A proves, Alan/Dash is more popular than Loretta, and she announces then and there that the series is over. As she storms out of the event, she is picked up/kidnapped and taken to meet an eccentric billionaire named Fairfax (a game and playful Daniel Radcliffe), who was pushed out of the family business, allowing him time to amass a huge collection of historical artifacts. The treasure he is currently seeking just happens to be the subject of Loretta’s latest book and includes well-researched clues Fairfax wants enhanced so he can find the prized piece in a place called “The Lost City.” Alan happens to see Loretta get snatched up, and arranges to save her, even though he has no actual military or mercenary training. Wisely, he enlists the help of an actual mercenary named Trainer (Brad Pitt, in an extended cameo) to lead the mission. But when Trainer is taken out of the equation early on, Alan must rise to the occasion, rescue Loretta, and lead them both to safety. Directed by relative newcomers Adam and Aaron Nee (Band of Robbers), The Lost City is a bit of an obvious action-comedy that suffers a great deal once Pitt leaves the screen. But more importantly, the film also isn’t especially funny. Bullock has set aside every ounce of on-screen charm she’s ever possessed and just plays Loretta as a one-note grumpy, bitter, frustrated writer, who seems to miss the fact that an actual adventure is happening around her that is providing her with all of the moments her isolated life has been missing. And although she has sworn off reviving the Dash character, with the clear inspiration for her next novel playing out in front of her, she’s too busy making fun of Alan to notice. The only thing worse than a humorless Sandra Bullock is Channing Tatum playing a character who lacks confidence to the degree Alan does. He’s good looking, popular, and not completely without helpful ideas, yet he whimpers and seems afraid of Loretta. What fun!  Since this is also a romantic journey, we assume there will be a few sparks between our leads, and there simply aren’t. That being said, a few solid laughs show up from supporting characters like Pitt’s Trainer, Randolph’s Beth, Patti Harrison as a social media guru working for Beth, and Oscar Nuñez as a local man living on the island where Loretta and Alan are trapped. It’s very easy to have Bullock and Channing cast in your film and believe you don’t have to actually write anything for them to say, since you would assume their natural charisma can carry them through any scene. You’d be wrong. Of course, they grab your attention for any number of reasons, but any movie needs the foundation of a decent script. You can’t Hail Mary your entire film by casting great personas and hoping that gets you through the entire production. That never works. It’s essentially what the filmmakers of The Lost City have done, and it shows. Because Bullock and Tatum are naturally gifted comic actors, sometimes a joke lands, of course, but that needs to happen far more often in a work like this, and it simply doesn’t. As a result, we get half-baked ideas, banter that sounds more like people just talking over each other, and sight gags that look expensive but don’t really amount to much. As much as I’m looking forward to Tatum making his way back into movies after a prolonged absence, I hope he does better than this moving forward. This one is a bit of a slog for all involved."
DWM_Doc3_TheLostCity,"Loretta Sage has an interesting past. She studied archeology in school, then became a best-selling romance novelist, with 20 books published: lots of heavy breathing and exotic adventures. She’s found it harder to function, though, both in her work and in her life, since her husband died, five years ago. Her latest novel is called “The Lost City of D.” That book shares most of its title with “The Lost City.” Loretta’s past becomes even more interesting present when a white-suited kajillionaire kidnaps her to help him translate some hieroglyphics or symbols or something to lead him to a legendary necklace called the Crown of Fire, located in, yes, the lost city of D. The ruins are “on a tiny forgotten island in the Atlantic,” the kajillionaire not very helpfully explains. (Much of the movie was shot in the Dominican Republic.) It just so happens that the tiny forgotten island has an active volcano on it — and it’s been rumbling — so fasten your geological seatbelts as well as your geographic ones. “The Lost City” is that kind of movie. But back to those novels: The heavy breathing between their covers can’t compare to the heavy breathing inspired by their covers. That’s because the image of Alan Caprison adorns them. He is a male model in full Fabio mode. (Remember him?) Loretta finds Alan annoying. He finds her irresistible, not that she notices. So Alan sets out to find and rescue her. To simplify things, just imagine a mix-and-mismatch version of “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and “Romancing the Stone.” You get action. You get romance. You get comedy. Sometimes it works — let’s say 12 percent of the time — and “The Lost City” can actually be deft and imaginative. Unfortunately, that leaves 88 percent which doesn’t. Sandra Bullock plays Loretta. “Plays” may not be the right word. “Works at”? “Browbeats”? Brittle and flinty, Bullock’s performance makes Loretta seem even more maladroit than she’s supposed to be. Where’s Amy Adams when you need her? Nicole Kidman? Jessie Buckley’s too young for the part, but a comedy role for her is overdue. It doesn’t help that Bullock spends most of the movie wearing a glittery magenta jumpsuit with a plunging neckline (don’t ask). “You’re basically a walking disco ball,” Alan points out when she wonders why the bad guys in pursuit keep finding them. It really doesn’t help, comparatively speaking, that Alan is played by Channing Tatum. With deadpan glee, he gives himself up to playing a beefcake doofus; and the result is quite enchanting. Alan is a gender-reversal blond bimbo. He’s a sexy dim bulb, only the curves are in different places. “Wait, I’m the damsel in distress?” a perplexed Alan asks the kajillionaire. See, he’s not as dumb as he looks. Playing the rich guy, Daniel Radcliffe displays a Rumpelstiltskin energy that’s quite winning. If only he could have loaned some to Bullock. Radcliffe has a beard whose bushiness nicely complements those thick eyebrows of his. It’s been 11 years since the last Harry Potter movie. It’s time for a new franchise. Somebody at Marvel should cast Radcliffe as Wolverine Jr.Da’Vine Joy Randolph, as Loretta’s editor, is overbearing. Her presence does prove crucial to resolving the plot. That’s not the case with Brad Pitt, who’s only briefly on hand. But he’s such fun in a brief appearance, playing a mercenary brought in by Alan to help spring Loretta, that that’s okay. Plus, he gives you a reason to wait through the first minute or two of the credits. I can reveal no more. Let’s just say it adds to the 12 percent and leave it at that."
DWM_Doc4_TheLostCity,"Sandra Bullock recently announced that she’d be taking a temporary break from acting, which is a bummer for movie lovers, especially fans of her unique comedic talents. Her knack for comedy is on full display in The Lost City, in which she and Channing Tatum play an opposites-attract-type couple stuck in an improbable jungle adventure worthy of the cheesiest Hollywood blockbusters. The Lost City means to parody those films, and Bullock and Tatum’s surprising level of chemistry aids tremendously in that quest. But the cardinal sin for any such film is to display the very cliches it mocks or, even worse, to stop being funny. The Lost City’s script eventually falls into both sinkholes and not even its star-studded cast’s muscular talent can save it from that self-created morass. Bullock stars as Loretta Sage, the disaffected novelist behind a bestselling series of pulpy romances featuring Dash McMahon. Tatum plays Alan, the cover model for Dash — bulging biceps, solid pecs, washboard abs and all. Loretta wishes that her fans cared about the interesting archeological and anthropological bits she peppers her novels with (she was a former explorer herself, in a past life), but the gals (and guys) in her audience swoon over and over again for Dash’s debonaire smile, rippling arm flexes and winking, blown kisses. Her publicist, Beth (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), tries her best to spruce up Loretta’s digital age persona, but the deadpan cynicism that Bullock excels at persistently gets in the way. Fed up, Loretta considers putting down her pen or — even worse — killing off Dash, when fate intervenes in the form of Abigail Fairfax, played by an impossibly grown-up Daniel Radcliffe. Abigail is an eccentric billionaire who spots in Loretta’s latest book a potential hint to a long-lost treasure on a remote island in the mid-Atlantic. The book is aptly titled The Lost City of D, and query why that part was dropped from the film’s title. In any event, with Loretta unwitting to help voluntarily, Abigail body snatches her to the island in question so she can help him find the mysterious treasure. Beth and Dash spring to the rescue, with the latter also enlisting the help of Navy Seal-turned-rogue agent Jack Trainer (an incredibly well-cast Brad Pitt). The Lost City’s filmmakers — directors and screenwriters Adam and Aaron Nee (Band of Robbers) — understand that their movie’s premise is inherently silly and even a bit ridiculous. That’s the whole point, which they gleefully embrace. The character exposition in the first 15 minutes is quick and amusing, permitting Bullock and Tatum to quickly form a tense, playful chemistry through fights and banter whose outcome is all but guaranteed. The next frame, which focuses mostly on Pitt’s character’s efforts to save Loretta while teaching Tatum’s Dash how to be a suave action hero, is even more metaphysically amusing and entertaining.  But, the film goes off the rails when Pitt makes an abrupt exit and the action focuses almost entirely on Loretta and Dash lost in the jungle, with an ineffective subplot of Beth trying her best to catch up to them spliced in between. At that point, The Lost City mostly runs out of steam, with its best jokes and gags behind it, and with sequences that go on for too long and ultimately stop being entertaining. The scene in the trailer with leeches on Tatum’s back and Bullock gagging is the most memorable for a solid 75 minutes of the film’s runtime. The rest crumbles around a bizarre character who Beth encounters in her travels, not to mention several ineffective gags. Loretta and Dash’s sequences, meanwhile, switch from the effective back-and-forth that permits both actors to shine, to physical humor surrounding the various henchmen chasing them, and, eventually, the inevitable cliches of the burgeoning romance between them.  Again, there is nothing inherently wrong with silly plotlines, and The Lost City does a much better job than most films within this genre of fully embracing the goofiness of its central conceits and having fun with it. The problem is the filmmakers’ constant allusions to seriousness while insisting that nothing should be taken seriously. Loretta’s repeated references to her life as an archeologist with her dead husband are either totally unnecessary or criminally underbaked — or perhaps both — and jar violently with the film’s supposed disclaimer of anything other than parody. The same is true for the expected romance between the two lead characters. Here, too, the problem is not the predictability, which the movie embraces and the audience accepts, but rather, the unfortunate distraction that the subplot causes, taking away from the film’s shinier, funnier moments. Tech-wise, The Lost City also provides little to write home about. This is a mid-budget production that will draw audiences based on its star power alone and the chance for some rollicking entertainment. The most memorable below-the-line element is perhaps the sequin-filled jumpsuit in which Bullock is forced to spend most of the proceedings, courtesy of experienced costume designer Deborah Lynn Scott (Avatar). The accouterments that characterize this onesie create a beacon for Radcliffe’s henchmen, who are hot on Loretta’s trail, and also advance the storyline while adding another layer of levity to the movie. Otherwise, the stunt department does most of the below-the-line heavy lifting. By the time the credits roll, it’s hard not to feel a wistful nostalgia for this kind of movie, as well as a sense of appreciation for Bullock, who despite the shortcomings of this script, makes The Lost City a sufficiently entertaining movie if you can get past its most tedious moments. One hopes that her acting pause is short-lived and that she, like the character she plays in this film, quickly finds a second wind, because audiences need joy more than ever these days and she knows how to deliver laughs, especially when paired with the right sparring partner."
DWM_Doc5_TheLostCity,"Once again, a comedy that relies on the gimmick of its premise and the charms of its leads is only worth those two things. With The Lost City, we have a fairly clever (if a tad bit familiar) setup and carrying it as far as they possibly can are a couple of movie stars playing it safely silly. The two stars are Sandra Bullock, playing a writer of romance novels who ends up in a jungle adventure that could have been in one of her books, and Channing Tatum, as an adventurer of sorts. Before you stop because you're sure you've heard this one already, the ""of sorts"" of Tatum's character is that he's the cover model for the adventurer character in the books. In other words, he's not actually a real hero of any kind. Based on the characters' shared lack of experience in matters of survival and treasure hunting, there's a good amount of comedic potential for the mishaps and misadventures of this stumbling, bumbling duo. As has become the trend of modern comedy out of Hollywood, though, the screenwriting quartet responsible for this one only have a few ideas, repeat and spread them out with the distraction of some side players, and hope the actors can charm and improvise their way into making us ignore how slim the material is. Bullock and Tatum are in game enough form here to make us wish we could watch the version of this movie that didn't count on them to carry the whole thing on their shoulders. Bullock plays Loretta, the romance fiction writer, who is still mourning the death of her husband five years prior and hesitant to leave her home. The two were archeologists by trade, and she has taken that career experience and transformed it into the sex-filled adventures of a treasure hunter and her chiseled, gender-studies-degree-possessing hunk of a fellow adventurer. Her latest novel, which was a slog to finish, might very well be her last, too, as she announces to a crowd of fans. They're more interested in seeing Tatum's Alan, a dim-bulb model who has portrayed Loretta's far-more-intelligent man-meat hero Dash on the cover of every one of her books. The author and the model have a falling out at the book event, and immediately after, Loretta is taken away by a couple of goons on orders from Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). As it turns out, the treasure in Loretta's recent book is real, and using the skills of her former career, she accurately translated a dead language in one part of the novel. Anyway, Fairfax abducts the author, flies her to a lost city in the jungle and next to a ready-to-blow volcano, and won't let her go until she translates a parchment that could lead him to the missing treasure. With the help of Loretta's publisher Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), Alan puts together a rescue mission for the woman on whom he's clearly smitten—with a lot of help from a professional mercenary (played by Brad Pitt in a glorified but amusingly straight-faced cameo). The rest of this is fairly predictable (although, while the Pitt character's exit from the story is inevitable, the means of his departure is a bit too realistic for the jokes that result). Loretta and Alan end up in the jungle alone, unprepared (She's in a sequined jumpsuit, and the thoughtful but absentminded Alan brings her fashionable, not practical, boots), constantly messing up the easier way to safety (A car has a lucky, albeit brief, stop right along the edge of a cliff), and pursued by Fairfax and his assortment of henchmen. All the while, Loretta and Alan banter and bicker their way through the tropical forest, up steep hills, down a river (where there's the inescapable gag of Alan being covered in leeches), and slowly but surely into each other's heart. There's not much to these characters, but Bullock, whose character at least has a general idea about surviving in inhospitable places, and Tatum, who's clearly having fun as a wannabe but never-could-be action-movie hero, have a nice-enough sense of chemistry. The screenplay (written by Oren Uziel and Dana Fox, as well as the fraternal directing team of Aaron and Adam Nee) almost seems to have been written with that sense of chemistry in mind, considering that the dynamic of this relationship is one joke (aside from a couple scenes in which Loretta hints at her grief and Alan suggests he cares more about the author's writing than she does), while the familiar travails of the adventure make up the movie's other one. The filmmakers display such little trust in and inspiration for the central plot that a decent portion of the story diverts to Fairfax, his goons, and Beth's attempt to reach her most profitable author. Such distractions are seemingly pointless but transparently necessary in the case of The Lost City. The movie gives us the promises of a somewhat clever idea and some good-humored actors, and then, it simply and unfortunately hopes for the best."
DWM_Doc6_TheLostCity,"After being taken hostage, a romance-adventure novelist and her cover model team up to find The Lost City in this action-adventure comedy. Big-budget action-adventure romantic comedies feel like a thing of the past. I’m so glad that Paramount didn’t unload the film because it’s worth every penny seeing it in a movie theater. I know, I know–Covid is starting to surge again so chances are likely that you might be waiting for VOD. It’s perfectly understandable but if you do see it in theaters, it’s the shared experience is worth it. Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) is a romance-adventure novelist. Her archaeologist husband has been dead for some time but the two shared many adventures. She’s starting to promote her new book with cover model Alan (Channing Tatum), who does his best to actually be “Dash.” Eccentric billionaire Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) asks her for help because Loretta’s latest book deals with the treasure he wants. She doesn’t have any interest in helping him. The next thing you know she gets kidnapped. She has a smart watch so one way or another, a rescue will take place. Alan brings on Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt) for a rescue mission. Alan and Loretta must work together to survive. While all this is happening, the island’s volcano is active and could blow at any minute. It takes publishing The Lost City of D to provide Loretta the direction she needs in her life. I mean, she cannot even take Alan seriously until he plays a role in rescuing her. Is this something that happens often to cover models? Maybe but I don’t know because that’s not an area in which I’m familiar. Publisher/marketing guru Beth Hatten (Da’Vine Joy Randolph) is putting her all into this tour but meeting resistance from Loretta in every step of the process. Beth even brings on a social media manager, Allison (Patti Harrison), to work with Loretta. But anyway, Beth gets quite the arc of her own during the process of rescuing Loretta. A shut-in author and a model are the last people that should be stuck in the jungle. We’re talking about an environment that is far from their comfort zone. To think that there was a time when Sandra Bullock didn’t want to make the film. Factor in a pandemic and well, this is a film that we need right now. When you’re this deep into a pandemic, comedies are an essential genre. They make us laugh and this one in particular offers quite a bit of fun. Who doesn’t want to have fun when watching a movie? Let alone the escapism! If you give me a big-budget film that provides escapist entertainment, I’m not going to turn it down. Well, unless it involves antisemitic or transphobic bigots. Adam Nee and Aaron Nee come from the world of independent filmmaking. It’s not always easy making the jump to studio pictures but having a producer like Sandra Bullock makes the transition easier. She’s the type of producer who gives her all. Both Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum have fantastic chemistry together. You can tell they’re also having fun and yet, you can’t help but notice the screwball energy going on. Well, when Daniel Radcliffe isn’t trying to kill them. Radcliffe is great in the role, too. It shows that he’s taking on more adult roles that couldn’t be further from that of a wizard. Meanwhile, Brad Pitt has a priceless cameo as ex-Navy SEAL Jack Trainer. If you think Bryce Dallas Howard running in heels in Jurassic World was bad, wait until you see the sparkly jumpsuit that costume designer Marlene Stewart provides for Sandra Bullock. I mean, it’s like having a flashback to 2015! There are costume designs that can make or break a career but Marlene Stewart’s work in The Lost City certainly could be her legacy. It also should be in the award conversation later this year. The Lost City gives us the escapist entertainment we need right now."
DWM_Doc7_TheLostCity,"Channing Tatum plays himbos like Mozart wrote symphonies. It’s a delicate art, and about much more than playing dumb. It’s about capturing the sweet, wounded desperation of a man who’s aware of the pressure on him to fulfil some kind of masculine ideal, but wouldn’t even know where to start. The himbo, I’d argue, is an underrated feminist archetype, a positive image of masculinity that simultaneously critiques the kinds of wild expectations we place on men. It’s all about subversion – that what he’s ultimately valued for aren’t the superficial markers of dominance or caveman brawn, but the pure goodness of his heart.Tatum has spent his entire career perfecting that kind of himbo, whether it be in the 21 Jump Street or Magic Mike films. And, finally, in The Lost City, he’s been paired with his ideal opposite: Sandra Bullock, the actor you call to play very smart women who still can’t seem to keep their lives together, who delivers in ways that are relatable as opposed to patronising. Though the film, directed by brothers Adam and Aaron Nee, presents itself as a 21st-century retread of Robert Zemeckis’s adventure romcom Romancing the Stone, it’s really the kind of project that’s suctioned itself to its A-list leads like a barnacle on a ship. Bullock is the flinty but loveable Loretta Sage, an archaeologist who’s become an emotional shut-in after her husband’s untimely death. She’s now slumming it – in her opinion – as the author of a series of steamy romance novels. Tatum is Alan Caprison, the cover model and now public face of Loretta’s hunky creation, Dash McMahon. His dedication to the role mildly repulses her. At Loretta’s latest book signing, he answers questions like he somehow had a hand in writing her work, before promptly ripping off his shirt. Alan, in a way, has become the physical manifestation of her own self-loathing. It doesn’t help that her publicist, Beth (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), insists that she turns up to the event in a sequinned jumpsuit so tight that it forces her to shuffle around like someone wrapped head-to-toe in medical bandages. It’s not the ideal fit for what happens next. Loretta is kidnapped by the unloved son (a very game Daniel Radcliffe) of a media mogul, Abigail Fairfax, who’s convinced the tidbits of historical knowledge littered throughout her books make her the key to finding the lost Crown of Fire. The treasure is said to be buried deep beneath a volcanic island out in the Atlantic, somewhere in the ruins of The Lost City of D, which has recently exposed itself to the elements. Well, technically, as Abigail points out, it’s exposed “just the tip”. Expect much more innuendo where that came from. The story here leans pretty hard on its “don’t judge a book by its cover” lessons, sometimes in the literal sense – Alan chastises Loretta for dismissing her books as nothing but low-brow shlock. But Bullock and Tatum are such dedicated professionals in the romcom field that it almost feels a little rude not to fall for their eventual romance. It’s lovely to watch the way Loretta warms up to Alan once his self-imposed image of masculinity starts to chip away, as she tenderly applies eczema cream to his back while laying out how she’d describe the moment in one of her novels. The Lost City, for the most part, finds that sweet spot between goofy and sincere, especially during the scenes where Tatum’s Alan tries to match up to the mercenary hired to rescue Loretta, played by none other than Brad Pitt. The star flips his long, blonde locks around like he’s back in Legends of the Fall, and smoulders with smug self-satisfaction. Tatum, in reaction, flounders magnificently. Unfortunately, the further away from Tatum and Bullock you get, the more the film struggles. The fact that Patti Harrison, as Loretta’s social media manager, steals away all of her scenes just by being weird enough to call someone’s grandmother a “slut”, highlights how deficient the writing can be in other places. Randolph is stuck playing the Black best friend whose entire existence gravitates around the white protagonist; there’s an attempt to poke fun at the adventure genre’s implicit exoticism that feels awkwardly half-hearted. But if you can force yourself to be myopic enough that nothing outside of its central romance matters? Well, then, The Lost City plays like a dream."
DWM_Doc8_TheLostCity,"There are few things as uplifting as the embrace of laughter. And one of the loveliest ways to experience that embrace is in the dark surrounded by strangers*, with popcorn in your lap and the warmth of a cinema screen brightening your eyes and mood. It takes an unabashedly funny film to unite a room in laughter, happily The Lost City is just that. Romance novelist Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) is a solitary soul. Once a globe trotter with a passion for breathing new life into ancient history, Loretta withdrew from the world following the death of her husband and has settled for living vicariously through the antics of her characters. Her hero Dash McMahon makes all her readers swoon but thanks to the dedication of a hunky cover model he has taken on a life of his own. If Loretta is ever to get a life, Dash must die. Dash is everything to Alan (Channing Tatum). Before he donned the flowing locks and disposable shirts demanded of Loretta’s leading man he was a nobody, he won’t go back to anonymity without a fight. Not an actual punch-up – Alan is a lover, not a fighter – but he is fiercely loyal to the author and the franchise and carefully oblivious to her disdain. Soon it will be time for Alan to step up and prove his mettle, a mercurial billionaire has Loretta in his crosshairs and (to her great irritation) the next chapter could prove deadly. Media dynasty brat Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) is basically Roman Roy with a childhood fixation on his Indiana Jones boxset. And now that he’s a grown-up, Fairfax wants ALL the treasure. Loretta’s meticulous research for her novel took her perilously close to the Crown of Fire – Fairfax’s quarry – and one translation, in particular, makes her an invaluable asset to him. When his ultimate cheese board fails to charm, he simply has his henchmen deliver Loretta to a remote Atlantic Island where he plans to stamp his foot extra hard until she complies. But Fairfax’s cunning plan did not account for Alan! Comparisons to Romancing the Stone are obviously inescapable here and superficially The Lost City shares plenty of common ground with the ‘80s classic. Yet it is so much more than that; part Nim’s Island, part The Lego Movie, a bit Dora and the Lost City of Gold and obviously a lot Indy; the real secret to The Lost City’s appeal is the winning charm of its cast. Adam and Aaron Nee’s action caper might not bring anything revelatory to the table in terms of plot but it’s a deliciously fluffy comedy confection and the charisma is palpable. Brad Pitt and Da’Vine Joy Randolph steal every scene they’re in as a CIA operative tasked with recovering Loretta and her dedicated publicist, respectively, Bullock and Tatum have fabulous bickering chemistry and honestly everyone looks like they’re having a ball. Alan lacks the Neeson nouse needed to mount a rescue but he has a huge heart and an indomitable spirit and he knows a man who can; his trainer, Jack Trainer, usefully in Alan’s phone under Trainer, because he is one. (We hope the Working Girl namecheck is an intentional nod to Harrison Ford.) Wily, knowledgable, certain-set-of-skilled and fit as f*ck, Jack (Brad Pitt) is every word of leading man Loretta ever wrote, made flesh. And Alan comes along for the ride, just in case. Despite gun-toting bad guys, an active volcano, hostile jungle conditions and a very rich manchild who doesn’t like to lose, nothing could possibly go wrong now. Sandra Bullock always delivers as a leading lady but with the right co-star to bounce off she sparkles. The odd couple pairing with Tatum allows her to use every weapon in her comedic arsenal from slapstick to sarcasm and Tatum makes an excellent foil – playing against his looks well – he is heartbreaking and hilarious in his bafflement over how ridiculously he is outmatched by Trainer. Full of personality and plenty of twists and turns to keep the predictable action skipping along, The Lost City is daft and delightful in equal measure; the perfect Easter holiday indulgence."
DWM_Doc9_TheLostCity,"There was a certain flavor of film that we used to see fairly often back in the day, films that were part rom-com, part adventure. These movies brought together action elements with love stories and steeped the whole thing in quippy banter and moments of slapstick. Now, were these movies always good? Of course not. But they were almost always fun – and that was more than enough. We don’t see as many of those films these days, what with the industry’s pivot to IP blockbusters and franchise development. But when they do turn up, it can be a reminder of how much fun these kinds of movie experiences can be.“The Lost City,” directed by Aaron and Adam Nee from a screenplay they co-wrote with Dana Fox and Oren Uziel, is a throwback to those delightful mélanges of comedy, adventure and romance. Thanks to some engaging performances, headlined by Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum, and a distinctly retro storytelling sensibility, the movie proves to be a lovely romp, a frothy, goofy trifle of a film that refuses to take itself too seriously. Sure, it might not be great cinema, but I definitely had a great time …and I bet you will too.Romance novelist Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) is stuck. She’s struggling to finish the latest book in her ongoing series, much to the chagrin of her agent Beth (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), and still dealing with the grief over the passing of her archaeologist husband a few years earlier. Reluctantly, Loretta agrees to appear at a convention for a Q&A, where she discovers that she will be joined by Alan (Channing Tatum), the airheaded beefcake cover model that has represented her hunky hero Dash McMahon since the beginning. There’s conflict between the two, with both sporting significant egos. But there’s more than meets the eye when it comes to Loretta Sage’s books. See, it turns out that she has long been incorporating aspects of the archaeological work she did with her husband into her books. And this newest one – “The Lost City of D” – is no exception. However, this time, someone noticed. Someone who views this as a unique opportunity. Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) is the son of a billionaire business mogul, obsessed with possessing the unpossessable. He believes that the Lost City of D is real, and that Loretta is the key to translating a pictographic language that will lead him to a lost tomb and a fabled treasure. And so, he does what weird rich guys do in these sorts of movies – he kidnaps her and whisks her away to a small island where, as it turns out, he has been excavating the very real lost city. And Alan sees her get taken. Being generally clueless, he’s at a loss for what to do. However, he is able to enlist the help of a Navy SEAL-turned-meditation trainer that he knows, a guy named Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt). Alan heads to the island to meet up with Trainer, only to insist that he be allowed to participate. Against his better judgment, Trainer allows Alan to come along. The rescue effort soon goes sideways, however, with circumstances leaving the equally-inept Alan and Loretta to make their way through the jungle on their own, all with Fairfax and his forces in pursuit. And as they do their best to stay safe and stay alive, the mismatched pair learns that they have more in common than they might have guessed, even as they embark on a real-life adventure far more exciting than anything Loretta could ever have written.“The Lost City” is reminiscent of ‘80s-era adventure films like “Romancing the Stone,” fun and irreverent love stories set in exotic locales and driven by grand adventure. This isn’t a film that intends to challenge; its sole aim is to entertain – an aim that it achieves with a breezy ease. The Nees aren’t reinventing the wheel here – they are capable, competent filmmakers who clearly have real affection for telling this type of story, so they just … do that. There’s very little fuss or muss at play here – everyone involved seems pretty clear on what kind of film that they’re making and, not for nothing, they all seem to be having a damned good time making it. The key to a film like this one’s relative success is how well the various elements are welded together. You need to have solid action-oriented set pieces and workable romantic chemistry and a collection of decent jokes. If you don’t have all three, it probably isn’t going to click. “The Lost City” clicks. Filming on location is important with this kind of movie. You don’t want to see people wandering around what is clearly a soundstage on a back lot somewhere. “The Lost City” is clearly happening in a real place – in this case, the Dominican Republic – which lends the proceedings a verisimilitude that contributes mightily. This helps the assorted action sequences – mostly well-executed chases, but a couple of surprising alternatives as well – stand out. And when you’ve got a central pairing like Bullock and Tatum, well … you’re in good shape. Bullock is still throwing rom-com heat; she’s prickly and self-conscious and awkward in all the best ways. Tatum – whose comedic talents are generally underrated – gives us a heart-of-gold himbo and just radiates charm. The two of them together are a delight, with bouncy banter and crackling energy – they generate more than enough to power this film. Meanwhile, Radcliffe is having a ball, making a meal out of every scene and generally embodying the just-inept-enough bad guy that a film like this needs. Oh, and Brad Pitt is a hoot – dude clearly understood the assignment. “The Lost City” is a reminder of Hollywood offerings past, a throwback movie experience that, while slight, is a heck of a lot of fun. At the risk of sounding curmudgeonly, they don’t often make ‘em like this anymore. One might even call it … a lost art. (For the record, “The Lost City” is better – MUCH better – than that joke.)"
DWM_Doc10_TheLostCity,"The Lost City is exactly what it says on the tin, and we appreciate its honesty. This movie isn't going to change anyone's life, but it's a good time at the movies, and there is some hidden depth there in the latter half for people looking for the emotional connection between the artist and their art. A reclusive romance novelist on a book tour with her cover model gets swept up in a kidnapping attempt that lands them both in a cutthroat jungle adventure. The Lost City is exactly the kind of movie that would have cleaned up at the box office before the pandemic, and going into its late March opening weekend; it's going to be interesting to see if the audience for this sort of popcorn movie is still there. There really isn't anything here that is trying to change the world, and there isn't anything about The Lost City that will make it a classic for decades to come. It'll have a reoccurring spot on network television and on streaming services, and it'll be one of those movies that someone can put on, and it won't offend anyone. If you have a group of people around you, no one will dislike it, no one is going to find anything offensive about it, and if you're channel surfing and you see it on, you'll likely stop to watch it. These types of movies used to do extremely well, but in a COVID-19 world and with people not entirely comfortable returning to theaters, are beautiful movie stars doing funny things enough to return to theaters? We'll have to see; the numbers at the time of writing are looking pretty good so far. As for the movie itself, the bare bones of The Lost City are taking all of the classic romance tropes that we've seen in books and films and turning them up to eleven, so we can take a comedic look at them. This is made even more self-aware by the fact that our heroine is an author of the exact genre of book that we are seeing play out on-screen, thus calling attention to all of the tropes happening in front of them and how things like wandering into the jungle is probably not the best idea when it comes to survival. When you have two stars like Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum, both of whom have fantastic comedic timing, making these jokes and calling attention to these tropes, you can't help but get swept away by the silly little adventure that these people are on. It's a little inconsequential on the surface, and for many people, that surface reading will be more than enough, and the movie is very honest about what it is and what it intends to be right out of the gate, which is nice. However, there is a bit more there if you're willing to look and even more so if you are a creative of any kind. Bullock is Loretta, an author who lost her husband and thus, lost her love for the genre that made her famous. The main character of her book was almost modeled on an idealized version of what her own life was like with her husband before she decided to write fiction and before he passed away. The city in question is one that Loretta and her husband spent time trying to find together. There is a disconnect between the author and her creation because she lost that connection. She has become disillusioned with not only the writing process but with her books as a whole. She doesn't see them as having any meaning; she doesn't see them as something to be proud of; she is an author ashamed of her own creation. Loretta's journey during The Lost City isn't just about finding a lost city or a lost treasure but reconnecting with that inner voice and passion that so many artists speak of. She is reminded that as much as she might look down on her work, it means a lot to other people, and she needs to remember that others have found meaning in something that she sees as meaningless. Alan (Tatum), her cover model who has nearly taken on the identity of the character of Dash from the books in real life, found meaning in being a version of a real-life Dash for fans. It was the romance novel version of the people who get emotional at comic-cons because they see actors that mean a lot to them acting very in character. That sort of transcendent fandom love that we don't need outside of the narrow scope of, well, sites like Bleeding Cool.  But The Lost City presents an option that could easily happen at a romance novel event. Loretta is also letting go of her husband and realizing that mourning in the way that she was, isolating herself from the world and everyone around her that cared, was prolonging the entire progress. While the events of The Lost City are jarring and ridiculous even by romance novel expectations, it's the jolt that Loretta needs to realize that she wasn't living before. She was surviving, and no loved one wants that for the people that they have to leave behind when they pass. There just happen to be explosions and leaches on Channing Tatum's perfect ass. Brad Pitt is doing a bit that if it doesn't make you excited for Bullet Train later this year, nothing will. Still, it is the thing that forces this character back to reality in a way that could ring true for many people who are merely surviving their life after loss and not living it. All of this makes The Lost City sound very heavy, and some moments are a real kick in the gut, but, in general, this is a brisk little movie where all of the aforementioned subtexts are there if you want and can be mostly bypassed if it isn't your thing. Daniel Radcliffe is on hand playing the kind of over-the-top insane villain that this genre is known for, and the unsung hero of the entire movie is Da'Vine Joy Randolph as Loretta's agent Beth who steals every single scene that she is in. The first half is a little rocky, but the latter half more than makes up for it, and this is a fun little time at the movies. The Lost City is a good time at the movies that will likely see constant replays at parties as background noise."
